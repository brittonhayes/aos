> A Warhammer REST API built with Go and Sqlite.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Get started with docker-compose to seed the database and start the API server.

```sh
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans --detach
```

or with [task](https://taskfile.dev/)

```sh
task up
```

## üìñ Documentation

API documentation is available in YAML format within the repository. The OpenAPI spec is used to generate the transport logic thanks to [goapi-gen](https://github.com/discord-gophers/goapi-gen).

- [View the OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/brittonhayes/warhammer/blob/main/api/openapi.yaml)

## üóÑÔ∏è Adding or Editing Data

All application data used to seed the database is editable in [fixtures/fixtures.yaml](https://github.com/brittonhayes/warhammer/blob/main/fixtures/fixtures.yaml). The API is built to be self-seeding and read-only, so if there is a need to add more data, simply add it to the fixtures file, rebuild and redeploy the API.
