> An unnoficial AoS REST API built with Go and Sqlite.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Get started with docker-compose to seed the database and start the API server.

```sh
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans --detach
```

or with [task](https://taskfile.dev/)

```sh
task up
```

## üìñ Documentation

API documentation is available in YAML format within the repository. The OpenAPI spec is used to generate the transport logic thanks to [goapi-gen](https://github.com/discord-gophers/goapi-gen).

- [View the OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/brittonhayes/aos/blob/main/api/openapi.yaml)

## üóÑÔ∏è Adding or Editing Data

All application data used to seed the database is editable in the [fixtures/](https://github.com/brittonhayes/aos/blob/main/fixtures/) directory. The API is built to be self-seeding and read-only, so if there is a need to add more data, simply add it to the fixtures files, rebuild and redeploy the API.

### Example - Adding a new alliance

To add a new entry to the database, just add a new object to the appropriate yaml fixtures file. In this case, `fixtures/alliances.yaml`. This processes is the same for all data types.

```diff
# fixtures/alliances.yaml
    - model: GrandAlliance
      rows:
        - id: order
          name: Order
          description: The forces of Order strive to bring unity and stability to the Mortal Realms. Composed of various factions, they fight against the forces of Chaos.
+       - id: chaos
+         name: Chaos
+         description: The forces of Chaos seek to corrupt and dominate the Mortal Realms. Made up of daemons, monsters, and twisted beings, they spread destruction wherever theygo.
```

## üîé Querying

The API supports GraphQL queries. The GraphQL playground is available at `/graphql` and the query endpoint is available at `/query`.

### Example - Get all units

```graphql
query {
  units {
    id
    name
    description
    grandAlliance
    points
  }
}
```

### Example - Get all units, filtering for a specific name

```graphql
query {
  units(filter: { name: "Lord" }) {
    id
    name
    description
    grandAlliance
    points
  }
}
```

## üì¶ Go Client

A Go client is available for the API. More examples are available in the [example/](https://github.com/brittonhayes/aos/tree/main/example) directory.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/brittonhayes/aos/client"
)

func main() {
	//	Setup a context with a timeout so we're covered in case of a slow response
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// Create a new http client
	c := client.NewClient(&http.Client{}, "http://aos-api.localhost/query", nil)

	// Get all allegiances
	resp, err := c.GetAllegiances(ctx, client.AllegianceFilters{})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// List the allegiances
	for _, a := range resp.Allegiances {
		println(a.Name)
	}
}
```

## üìà Monitoring

Application observability is instrumented with OpenTelemetry. Telemetry is available in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). Application tracing is powered by [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/). All application services are behind [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) reverse proxy.

When running with docker-compose, the following services are available:

- API is available at [http://aos.localhost:8090](http://aos.localhost:8090)
- Documentation is available at [http://aos.localhost:8090/docs](http://aos.localhost:8090/docs)
- Traefik Dashboard is available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Prometheus is available at [http://prometheus.localhost:8090](http://prometheus.localhost:8090)
- Grafana is available at [http://grafana.localhost:8090](http://grafana.localhost:8090)
