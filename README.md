> An unnoficial AoS REST API built with Go and Sqlite.

## ‚ú® Try the API (hosted)

- API: https://aos-api.com/
- Documentation: https://aos-api.com/docs

## ‚ö° Quick Start (self-hosted)

Get started with docker-compose to seed the database and start the API server.

```sh
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans --detach
```

or with [task](https://taskfile.dev/)

```sh
task up
```

## üìñ Documentation

API documentation is available in YAML format within the repository. The OpenAPI spec is used to generate the transport logic thanks to [goapi-gen](https://github.com/discord-gophers/goapi-gen).

- [View the OpenAPI Spec](https://github.com/brittonhayes/aos/blob/main/api/openapi.yaml)

## üóÑÔ∏è Adding or Editing Data

All application data used to seed the database is editable in the [fixtures/](https://github.com/brittonhayes/aos/blob/main/fixtures/) directory. The API is built to be self-seeding and read-only, so if there is a need to add more data, simply add it to the fixtures files, rebuild and redeploy the API.

### Example - Adding a new alliance

To add a new entry to the database, just add a new object to the appropriate yaml fixtures file. In this case, `fixtures/alliances.yaml`. This processes is the same for all data types.

```diff
# fixtures/alliances.yaml
    - model: GrandAlliance
      rows:
        - id: order
          name: Order
          description: The forces of Order strive to bring unity and stability to the Mortal Realms. Composed of various factions, they fight against the forces of Chaos.
+       - id: chaos
+         name: Chaos
+         description: The forces of Chaos seek to corrupt and dominate the Mortal Realms. Made up of daemons, monsters, and twisted beings, they spread destruction wherever theygo.
```
